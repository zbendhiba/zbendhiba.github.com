I recently had the incredible opportunity to join a diverse Moroccan panel on the popular YouTube podcast, [GeeksBlabla](https://geeksblabla.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

In the episode, we delved into our experiences as tech speakers and/or developer relations (DevRel) professionals. Even for an experienced speaker, I enjoyed listening to the panelists share their different challenges and tips on better managing time. This episode of GeeksBlabla not only offered me a chance to reflect on my path but also to connect with fellow speakers who are equally passionate about tech and community building. 

For Moroccan speakers interested in the convergence of technology communication and community engagement, this podcast episode is a must-watch
