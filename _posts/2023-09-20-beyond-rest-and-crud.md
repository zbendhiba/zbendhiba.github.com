Last week, I had the privilege of co-presenting a tech talk alongside [Erin Schnabel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinschnabel/){:target="_blank"}. Together, we delved into the world of Microservices Integration Patterns.

In this session, we leveraged Apache Camel to explore integration patterns that add flexibility and resilience to your evolving architecture.
