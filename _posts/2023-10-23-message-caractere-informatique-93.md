Hey everyone! Guess what? I had the amazing opportunity to be part of Message à caractère informatique podcast - episode 93 at the Devoxx Morocco conference recently, and it was such a fantastic experience!

We dived into so many interesting topics, like Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzar, the brand-new Tesla APIs, and the hot topics in open source, discussing the Cillium certification, [Apache Camel 4.1 release](https://camel.apache.org/blog/2023/10/camel41-whatsnew/){:target="_blank"}. We uncovered the first major security flaw in HTTP, and delved into the latest happenings at [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to tune in and catch our lively discussion in French, you can find the full episode [here](https://www.clever-cloud.com/podcast/lia-marocaine-plie-le-game-des-api-comme-un-apache-certifie/){:target="_blank"}. 
A big shoutout to Quentin Adam and Devoxx Morocco team for this exciting opportunity! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
