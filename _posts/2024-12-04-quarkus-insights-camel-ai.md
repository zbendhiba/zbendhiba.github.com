Last week, I had the privilege of co-presenting a tech talk alongside [Otavio Piske](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orpiske/){:target="_blank"}. Together, we delved into todayâ€™s landscape of what we offer to integrate in the GenAI space using Apache Camel.

In this session, we briefly introduced Apache Camel. We leveraged Apache Camel LangChain4j and vector database capabilities for RAG and to create autonomous agents. The Quarkus demos included:
- Data ingestion into vector databases for RAG
- RAG leveraging the large library of Camel components. In the demo, we showcased the JIRA component
- Autonomous agents that leverage Camel routes as tools
