### Hello there 👋
I’m Zineb Bendhiba, an Open Source Java developer with extensive experience, deeply passionate about navigating the complex challenges within Cloud Native environments. I am dedicated to using and contributing to Open Source projects to tackle these challenges.

I believe in the strength and adaptability of Apache Camel as an integration framework. Within the Apache Camel project, I actively contribute to diverse challenges, demonstrating my ability to innovate and lead in the field. This reflects my enduring commitment to addressing complex problems throughout my career.

My engagement in the Apache Camel community has enriched my expertise in cutting-edge Cloud-native technologies, including Kubernetes, Quarkus, serverless architectures, and AI. I continuously explore and implement novel approaches to apply this knowledge in practical, impactful ways.

Engaged in various open source and women in tech communities, I actively participate as a tech speaker, sharing insights and experiences with fellow enthusiasts.
