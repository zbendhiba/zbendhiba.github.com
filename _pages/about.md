### Hi there 👋

I'm Zineb Bendhiba, an experienced Open Source Java developer with a passion for Enterprise Integration & Cloud-native technologies. I'm an active contributor to the open source integration project Apache Camel.

I'm passionate about using open source tools to help organizations overcome the toughest integration challenges, and I believe that Apache Camel is one of the most powerful and flexible integration frameworks available today. 

Through my work with Apache Camel, I've gained a wealth of experience working with modern Cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes, Quarkus and Knative, and I'm always looking for new ways to apply this knowledge to real-world challenges.
